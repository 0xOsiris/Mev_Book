# Geometric Analysis of CFMM Networks 

## Brief Overview
The aim of this informal writeup is to simply give an interpretation of CFMM networks through a geometric lense. I am writing this to deepen my personal understanding of the topological structure of CFMM networks, but maybe this could provide some deeper clarity to the geometric/visual thinkers out there. 

## Trading Function
Every constant function market maker has some locally constant function parametrizing strict constraints on the utility of a trade. The trading function varies across cfmms. The primary constant functions used are geometric mean, and weighted geometric mean.

Geometric Mean:

$R_1*...*R_n)^1/n$
